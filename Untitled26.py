1.  * is an expression
    'hello' is a String
    -87.8  is a Value
    - / * +  is an expression. Expression is collection of operands and operators
    6 is a Value
    
    
2.  Difference between string and variable. 
      String is a sequence of characters.  Ex: "This is Python Programming"
        
      Vairable is you can store value in a varaible. Variables is reserved memory location
              to store values . Ex: a= 20, b=30, str="Mystring"  
            
3. DAta types in Python:
    
     String, int, bool.  Ex: str= "Python",  a=5, b='TRUE'    str is STring datatype, a is int data type
                              b is Boolean
            
            

4. Expresions are combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.Expressions need
    to be evaluated.If you ask to print an expression the interpretor evaluates the expression and 
    displays the result.
    
    
    
5.Difference between expression and statement:
     Expresions are combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.Expressions need
    to be evaluated.
    
    Statements is an instruction that python interperetor can execute.

8. Eggs is a valid vaiable name   while 100 is not a valid varaible name. In variable you can assign some values
and store in memory locations whereas 100 is a value , it needs a variable to assign and store in the memory


9.   Three functions to get integer, floating point and string are:
    
      int()
        str()
        float()
        
        
10.  "I have eaten" +  99 +  "burritoes"   will give error since you cannot concatinate strring with integer.

     the correct output should be
    "I have eaten " + "99"  + "burritoes"
